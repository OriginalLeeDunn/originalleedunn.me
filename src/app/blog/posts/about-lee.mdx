# About Lee

## Introduction

Hi, I'm Lee Dunn — a builder at heart, a technologist by trade, and a creative thinker by nature. My journey spans the intersection of game development, artificial intelligence, and full-stack engineering. Whether I’m crafting immersive virtual experiences, designing intelligent systems, or building tools that empower others, I aim to merge code and creativity into something meaningful.

## Main Content

I started my career in tech as a Systems Administrator and gradually evolved into a DevOps lead, managing automation and infrastructure at Nordstrom Corp. With a strong foundation in systems, I transitioned toward AI and game development, building bots, automations, and experimental digital tools that push the boundaries of what's possible — both in virtual spaces like *Highrise* and in broader open-source ecosystems.

My creative work includes AI-powered tools, indie game prototypes, and a unique visual identity under the brand `original_lee >-dunn`, which reflects both my roots and my forward-looking mindset. I’ve built projects that span:

- **AI Chatbot Systems** – Including multi-agent frameworks that can learn, collaborate, and evolve.
- **Game Tools** – From interactive bots in Highrise to generative art workflows using ComfyUI and Blender.
- **Full-Stack Applications** – Websites and platforms that integrate payment splitting (ETH, BTC, PayPal), NFT marketplaces, and user-generated content engines.
- **DevOps Leadership** – Automating workflows, monitoring pipelines, and optimizing deployments in large-scale environments.

But my work isn’t just about tech. I’m also a storyteller and systems thinker. My upcoming projects include short narrative series, animated content inspired by Cartoon Network, and virtual studio tools for solo creators — all powered by AI.

## Conclusion

I’m driven by curiosity, systems design, and the thrill of building something that didn’t exist before. Whether I’m scripting a bot, designing a UI, or creating a digital world, I bring a hacker’s mindset and an artist’s eye.

Thanks for stopping by and learning a bit about me. Feel free to explore my portfolio, join me on Twitch, or connect if you’re curious about collaborating.

> Stay original. Build boldly.
