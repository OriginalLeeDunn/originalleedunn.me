# Best Free Hosting for My Static Portfolio

## Introduction

After containerizing my website portfolio with Docker, I started looking for a solid **free hosting option**. My needs are minimal: a **static site**, no dynamic backend, and just enough functionality to allow users to contact me via email. 

I evaluated three popular platforms — **Fly.io**, **Digital Ocean**, and **Vercel** — to determine which would best support my goals while keeping things cost-free and developer-friendly.

## The Shortlist

### Fly.io

**✅ Pros:**

- Full Docker support with fast global edge deployment
- Free tier includes up to **3 shared 256MB VMs**
- Works directly from the CLI with `flyctl`
- Custom domains and HTTPS included
- Handles scaling and future backend needs if I ever expand

**⚠️ Cons:**

- Cold start times can occur on inactive apps
- Slightly more involved setup (requires `fly.toml` config)
- Bandwidth-limited on the free tier (160GB/month)

**Verdict:** Ideal if you're Docker-native and want global edge capabilities. Feels very "infra-savvy" and future-proof.

### Digital Ocean (App Platform)

**✅ Pros:**

- Easy-to-use GUI, GitHub integration, and CI/CD
- Supports Docker containers, though more focused on app logic
- Free tier offers **3 static sites** with custom domain and HTTPS
- Reliable infrastructure and clear upgrade paths

**⚠️ Cons:**

- Free static sites **don't support Docker** (only non-containerized apps)
- Docker deployment requires a paid plan
- Better suited for backend/full-stack apps than plain static

**Verdict:** Only makes sense if I switch from Docker to a static file deployment like HTML/JS/CSS from GitHub.

---

### Vercel

**✅ Pros:**

- Optimized for frontend/static sites
- GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket integration
- Free tier includes custom domains, HTTPS, and CI/CD
- Global CDN + edge caching = blazing fast load times
- Automatic deployments on git push

**⚠️ Cons:**

- Doesn’t natively support Docker containers
- Not suitable for anything that needs server containers (e.g. backend in container)

**Verdict:** Best if you're serving static assets without needing a container — it's a **perfect fit** if I switch from Docker to just deploying raw static files.

---

## My Decision

Ultimately, I chose **Vercel** for my portfolio.

Since my site is static, I decided to strip it out of the container and deploy the raw assets directly. Vercel gave me:

- The fastest global delivery
- The cleanest UI and DevEx
- Custom domain + HTTPS, for free
- Instant deploys via GitHub

And it didn’t cost me a cent.

## Deployment Flow

I converted my Dockerized site to a static build folder and connected it to Vercel:

```bash
npm run build
# Or however your static files get generated
```

Then I pushed to a GitHub repo, linked the repo to Vercel, and my site was live in minutes.

---

## Conclusion

While Docker is awesome for development and flexibility, sometimes the simpler path is the better one — especially when it’s free and lightning fast.

If I ever need backend functionality or full containerization, I’ll revisit **Fly.io**. But for now, **Vercel is the smoothest ride** for hosting static sites.

> Keep it simple. Let the tools do the heavy lifting.
